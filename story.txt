John knew eating a Bratwurst in a borrowed Porche was a bad idea. 
There he was, on his way from Raesfeld heading to Eltz with his trust hund, Bark Twain.
Along the way, John knew that he had to stop for some Gabaeck. 
John went into the famous local Baeckerei while wearing his white Lederhose. 
There, he bought the tastiest brot he had ever tasted!
After eating the bread, John ordered an Apfelkuchen to-go, and went home and ate it in front of the Klimaanlage. 
Quite quickly, John realized the Klimaanlage was giving him frostbite.
